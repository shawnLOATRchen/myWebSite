        <p>I met Shawn in my first trip to Silicon Valley. He immediatly impressed me for his hard work and dedication. When he talks you can hear passion flowing through your ears, not just words.</p>

        <p>Shawn is a strong team player and often going above and beyond to help his peers even if the issues are outside his immediate scope of responsibilities. Heâ€™s led team on-boarding session for new interns, curated good learning resources to share, and is quick to step up and guide other teams through roadblocks.</p>

        <p>Shawn is one of the few people that I've ever met with strong self-learning ability and solid programming technics. I believe he could create greater value to his organization.</p>
